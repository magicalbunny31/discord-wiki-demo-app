# wiki-demo-app
a discord.js app that customises wiki images for my projects 🐾


### tell me, how does this work?
a bot user is used in order to establish a gateway connection to receive interactions 🤖
this is because discord.js is a ws lib and i don't have a https webserver for POST reqs lmao 📔
if i do actually get my paws on a webserver then i'll switch to that 🌐


### what's with the guild?
commands will be created on the guild-level of said guild id, to save with update times ⌚
